            The <b>Material Kit</b> is built on top of Bootstrap 3, so you can safely use it on your existing or new Bootstrap project. No line of code from Bootstrap 3 was changed, so you don't have to worry about undesired effects in your work.
        </p>
        <p>
            We provide all the necessary CSS resources. To get going, just include <code>assets/css/material-kit.css</code> in your HTML template. Your project will get the new look.

            The easiest way to start is to use our <a href="template.html" target="_blank">start-up template</a> where all the files are already included and ready to use.
